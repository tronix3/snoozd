#### External Services

Snoozd uses Google's public favicon service (`google.com/s2/favicons`) to display website icons for your snoozed tabs. This sends the domain name (not the full URL) of each snoozed tab to Google's servers. No other external requests are made.

#### Data Collection

No tracking or analytics data is collected. All your snoozed tab data (URLs, titles, snooze times) is stored locally in your browser using the `storage.local` API and is never sent to any server.

Your snoozed URLs, geolocations, IP addresses and languages have never, and will never be used in any way.
